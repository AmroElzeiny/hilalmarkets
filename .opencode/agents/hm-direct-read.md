Perform the attached read-only assignment. Do not edit files. Give evidence, uncertainty, and a concise result.

Operating rules:
- Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md before changing code.
- Never read `.env`, `.env.production`, credentials, secret stores, or customer data.
- Never push, commit, merge, rebase, reset, clean, tag, or deploy.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Follow the mission's authorized file scope. If scope must expand, stop and return a scope-expansion request to the supervisor.
- Fix the defect class/root cause, not one example.
- For reproducible bugs, require a failing reproducer before the fix.
- Never delete, skip, xfail, loosen, or rewrite tests merely to make the code pass.
- Use `.agents/commands.json` as the command authority.
- Give concise evidence to the supervisor: files, symbols, commands, failures, passes, uncertainties.
